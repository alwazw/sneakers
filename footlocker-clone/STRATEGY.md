# STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE

## Why MedusaJS?
We need a "Headless" backend that handles complex variants (e.g., Size 10 + Red + Wide Width) out of the box. Building this from scratch in MERN is error-prone.

## Why Next.js 15?
FootLocker relies on SEO. Next.js Server Side Rendering (SSR) ensures Google indexes our sneaker pages instantly.

## The "Jules + Gemini" Workflow
1. **Jules** writes the code and the test.
2. **User** runs the test.
3. **Gemini CLI** analyzes the test result and updates this Plan.
