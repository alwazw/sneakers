This is a great sign. Jules is working correctly. It caught a logic error in the plan: you can't "ping" the application port (9000) if the application isn't installed yet.

We need to tell Jules to split this into two parts:

Infrastructure (Now): Get the containers running (DB + Redis).

App Install (Next): Install Medusa, then port 9000 will open.

Here is the exact response to copy and paste back to Jules to unblock it.

Copy/Paste this to Jules:
Clarification: You are correct. Good catch.

Revised Requirements:

The Medusa Container: Since the app isn't installed yet, configure the medusa-backend service in docker-compose.yml to run a "keep-alive" command (e.g., command: tail -f /dev/null or sleep infinity) just so the container stays running and we can exec into it later.

The Validation Script: Modify tests/validate_infra.sh to:

Check that Port 5432 (Postgres) is listening.

Check that Port 6379 (Redis) is listening.

Do NOT check Port 9000 yet. Instead, check that the container named medusa-backend has a STATUS of "Up" (using docker ps).

Port Mapping: Still map 9000:9000 in the compose file so it's ready for Step 1.2.

Proceed with the Proposed Plan:

Create docker-compose.yml (with the keep-alive command).

Create tests/validate_infra.sh (checking DB/Redis ports + Medusa container status).

Give me the commands to run.

For You (The Project Manager)
Once Jules gives you the code:

Run the command Jules provides (likely docker compose up -d).

Run the test: bash tests/validate_infra.sh.

If it says SUCCESS: You have officially finished Step 1.1.

Next Step Preview: We will then ask Jules to "Enter the medusa container and install the app," which will finally open port 9000.
